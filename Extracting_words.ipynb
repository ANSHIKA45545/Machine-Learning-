For example, splitting sentences into words or words into characters.\\nStemming and lemmatization: These are normalization methods to bring words into their root or canonical forms. While stemming is a heuristic process to achieve the root form, lemmatization utilizes rules of grammar and vocabulary to derive the root.\\nStopword Removal: Text contains words that occur at high frequency yet do not convey much information (punctuations, conjunctions, and so on). These words/phrases are usually removed to reduce dimensionality and noise from data.\\nCorpora: The starting point of any text analytics process is the process of collecting the documents of interest in a single dataset. This dataset is central to the next steps of processing and analysis. This collection of documents is generally called a corpus. Multiple corpus datasets are called corpora. \\nTagging: The process of tagging will involve getting a text corpus, tokenizing the text and assigning metadata information like tags to each word in the corpora.\\nChunking: Chunking is a process which is similar to parsing or tokenization but the major difference is that instead of trying to parse each word, we will target phrases present in the document. \\n\\nPrerequisites:\\n•\\tBasic knowledge of Python programming\\n•\\tFamiliarity with string operations\\nRequired Tools:\\n•\\tPython installed on computer\\n\\nMethod 1: Without using any dedicated library\\nSteps:\\nSteps 1: Define the Punctuation Characters\\nA set of punctuation characters that should be removed from the sentence with be define.\\nStep 2: Normalize the Sentence\\nThe sentence will be converted to lowercase to standardize the words.\\nStep 3: Remove Punctuation\\nAny punctuation characters will be removed from the sentence.\\nStep 4: Tokenize the Sentence\\nThe cleaned sentence will be split into individual words.\\n'"
